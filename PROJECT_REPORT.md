The system's core architecture consists of:

1. **Frontend Layer**: A React-based single-page application with role-specific interfaces rendered based on user permissions. The frontend uses React Context API for state management and communicates with the backend services through RESTful APIs. Tailwind CSS provides the styling foundation with a responsive design approach that adapts to different device sizes.

2. **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, request routing, and response formatting. This centralizes common concerns like security, rate limiting, and monitoring.

3. **Microservices**: The business logic is distributed across specialized services:
   - Order Service: Manages the lifecycle of customer orders
   - Menu Service: Handles menu items, categories, and availability
   - User Service: Controls user accounts, authentication, and permissions
   - Analytics Service: Processes business data for reporting and insights
   - Notification Service: Manages real-time alerts and communications

4. **Database Layer**: Uses Supabase PostgreSQL for structured data storage with row-level security policies for fine-grained access control. The database schema is designed to maintain data integrity while supporting efficient querying patterns for different use cases.

5. **Real-time Communication Layer**: Implements Socket.io for websocket-based real-time updates between clients and servers, enabling features like live order tracking and immediate kitchen notifications.

### Database Design

The database design follows a relational model with carefully structured relationships between entities. Core tables include:

- Users: Stores authentication information and personal details for customers, staff, and administrators
- Roles: Defines permission sets for different user types
- Menu Items: Contains food and beverage offerings with descriptions, images, pricing, and availability
- Categories: Organizes menu items into logical groupings
- Orders: Records customer orders with status, timestamps, and payment information
- Order Items: Links orders to menu items with quantity and modifications
- Payments: Tracks transaction details and payment methods
- Feedback: Stores customer ratings and comments

The database implements referential integrity constraints to maintain data consistency and includes appropriate indexing for optimized query performance. Row-level security policies restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend of TastyBites is built using React 18 with TypeScript, providing a robust type-safe development experience. The application employs a component-based architecture with carefully designed reusable components organized by feature and functionality.

React Router v6 handles routing with role-based access control, ensuring users can only access authorized areas of the application. The UI is crafted using Tailwind CSS, enabling rapid development of responsive interfaces while maintaining consistency through a custom design system.

State management is implemented through a combination of React's Context API for global state and local component state for UI-specific concerns. This approach provides a good balance between simplicity and scalability, avoiding the complexity of more heavyweight state management libraries while still enabling effective state sharing between components.

For enhanced user experience, the application incorporates:
- Framer Motion for fluid animations and transitions
- React Hook Form for efficient form handling and validation
- Recharts and Chart.js for data visualization in the analytics dashboards
- React Hot Toast for non-intrusive user notifications

The application follows a mobile-first responsive design approach, ensuring optimal user experience across devices from smartphones to large desktop monitors. Layout adjustments are made at different breakpoints to maximize screen real estate and maintain usability.

### Backend Implementation

The backend system is built on Node.js with Express, providing a lightweight yet powerful server infrastructure. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions for predictable and stateless communication with frontend clients.

Supabase serves as the primary database and authentication provider, offering:
- PostgreSQL database with powerful query capabilities
- Built-in authentication system with JWT token management
- Storage solution for menu images and assets
- Row-level security for fine-grained access control

The backend implements comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Error handling follows a consistent pattern with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages for debugging.

For real-time features, Socket.io establishes WebSocket connections that enable instant notifications for new orders, status updates, and kitchen communications. This bidirectional communication channel creates a responsive experience for all users of the platform.

### Payment Processing

TastyBites integrates with Razorpay for secure payment processing, supporting multiple payment methods including credit/debit cards, UPI, netbanking, and popular digital wallets. The payment flow is designed to be secure and user-friendly:

1. When a customer places an order, the application calculates the total amount including taxes and any applicable fees.
2. A payment request is created on the server through the Razorpay API, generating a unique order identifier.
3. The client-side Razorpay SDK presents a secure payment interface where customers can select their preferred payment method and complete the transaction.
4. After payment completion, Razorpay sends a callback to the TastyBites server, which verifies the payment signature to prevent tampering.
5. Upon successful verification, the order is confirmed and processing begins.

All payment information is handled according to PCI-DSS compliance standards, ensuring customer financial data is protected throughout the transaction process.

### QR Code System

A distinctive feature of TastyBites is its QR code system that enables contactless menu browsing and ordering. Each restaurant table is assigned a unique QR code that, when scanned, directs customers to the digital menu with the table already identified in the system.

The QR code system supports several use cases:
- Table-specific ordering for dine-in customers
- Direct links to specific menu categories or items
- Special promotion access with automatic discount application
- Quick reordering for returning customers

The administrative dashboard includes tools for generating, managing, and analyzing QR code usage, providing insights into customer engagement patterns.
